<img src="IMAG0040.jpg" style="width:320px;height:320px;">
<p>	Kevin is 24 years old currently working at Digital Divide Data as a trainee on Amazon Web Service. Being at DDD has really taught me alot in terms of what it means to be a team player and helping each other in terms of projects and on individual level. Apart from being an employee am also a student at Kenyatta University, graduating this year with a degree in Information Technology. I am passionate about technology in terms of what is trending. </p> 
<p>	During my free time i tend to listen to music and watch movies and also enjoy life as we only have one life to live.
